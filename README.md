# Living World
## Short description
An exercise for "Advanced C++" lecture at my university. 
Project consist of living world simulation in terminal window. 
World consist of different organisms that can attack each other or reproduce.
Project implements serialization for saving and loading state of simulation.
## Technology used 
Project is written in C++, using basic pointers for gaining better understanding of memory managment in C++.
Project also use [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library for serialization of its state.
